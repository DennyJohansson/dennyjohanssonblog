## The sourdough obsession
### It all started on OrnÃ¶
My family celibrated new years eve 2019 at our friends parents house in Stockholm Archipelago! It was a really great, we cooked a lot of good food and slept early because our daugther was 2 and our friends was pregnant! Anywaaay I found this dough machine and tried to bake some bread, I totally got obsessed! The next months I was baking bread daily, and shortly I started my own sourdough and also joined a sourdough forum on Facebook! Now 2,5 years later I still have the same sourdough but I only bake once a week! I really love working with a dough, it makes me happy!

### Bakers percentage and the road the perfect bread
I always use the bakers percentage when I start my dough! I'm constantly testing different percentages to one day get the perfect bread.

To calculate the bakers percentage of a dough the flour will be the base:

- 1000g flour
- 800g liquid

This would give an bakers percentage of 80%! Then I have around 10%-20% sourdough and 2% salt.

- 1000g flour
- 800g liquid (80%)
- 150g dourdough (15%)
- 20g salt (2%)

I always have to calculate and write this down and decided to make my life a little easier and started to work on a dough calculater app!

### Tech choice!
I wanted o try writing React with Clojure and decided to go with Reagent!

## Clojure
Rich Hickey is the creator of Clojure and I love watching youtube videos on he's talks! He also have created an immutable database called Datomic!

I been a fan of Clojure since the first time I saw it, it's an functional language on the Java platform but as a Javascript dev I first noticed it because of ClojureScript! In ClojureScript you can write Clojure and still import Javascript libraries with npm, but it depends on the extension.

There is 3 diff extensions for Clojure

- `clj` compiles to java
- `cljs` compiles to javascript
- `cljc` can be compiled to either but then you can't use javascript

### Immutable data structures and atom
Clojure have immutable data structures and if you want to use something as a state you can use atoms, an atom is a container for a value and the value can be swaped with a new value. Atoms are free of race-conditions and works very well with mutli threads.

### Reagent

[Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) is a React wrapper for ClojureScript! I really wanted to try this because it looks so clean!

I reused these examples from [Reagents git](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent#examples)!

```example from Reagents git
(defn some-component []
  [:div
   [:h3 "I am a component!"]
   [:p.someclass
    "I have " [:strong "bold"]
    [:span {:style {:color "red"}} " and red"]
    " text."]])
```

#### r/atom
Reagent have their own version of atom that will re-render components when needed, it's like Redux but without any boilerplate.

```Also example from Reagents git
(defonce click-count (r/atom 0))

(defn state-ful-with-atom []
  [:div {:on-click #(swap! click-count inc)}
   "I have been clicked " @click-count " times."])

```

### REPL, Read Eval Print Loop 
Also worth mentioning is the Clojure REPL! You can evaluate the code inside the editor like it was the browser console, also a REPL is connected to the browser. I have not been experimenting anything with it and can only imagine what to do with it!

### Performance of Reagent
[Reagent mentions](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent#performance) that sometimes Reagent is actually __faster then React__ a lot of times!

### The work Dough calculator
I started working on this project a long time ago but then I got so frustrated with the sliders logic and never really got it to work as I wanted! 

Now stared this blog I got motivated to pick it up again, this time my brain had already figured out how it should be done and it went pretty fast!

To start a Reagent project I first needed to install [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) and OpenJDK v8, I used brew for both:

```
brew install leiningen
brew install openjdk@8
```

Leiningen is the npm/yarn of Clojure and can be used to start up a new Reagent project similar to `Create React App`

```
lein new reagent doughcalc +figwheel
```

This will create the new Reagent project and also add [figwheel](https://figwheel.org/), I will use figwheel to build and hot load. Figwheel also connects a REPL that can be used! I saw a great [youtube talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-kj2qwJa_E) from the Author of figwheel, it's acutally a fantastic talk that I highly recommend! Anyway fighweel is now added as a task on leiningen:

```
lein fighweel
```

Now the dev environment is up and running and ready for code! I browsed around and found an example very close to what I needed! It was 3 sliders calculating BMI, this was a good starting point for me being new to Reagent and Clojure. The code I now had was:

1. My app state inside an reagent/atom state, functioning like Redux.
```
(def perc-data (reagent/atom (calc-perc {:flour 1600 :liquid 1200 :sourdough 20 })))
```

2. The `calc-perc` function is calculating the bakers percentage! 
```
(defn calc-perc [{:keys [flour liquid perc] :as data}]
  (let [h (/ flour 100)]
    (if (nil? perc)
      (assoc data :perc (/ liquid h)) 
      (assoc data :liquid (* perc h)))))
```
3. The slider component that is being used to choose flour, liquid, percentage and sourdough
```
(defn slider [param value min max invalidates]
  [:input {:type "range" :value value :min min :max max
           :style {:width "100%"}
           :on-change (fn [e]
	                (let [new-value (js/parseInt (.. e -target -value))]
			  (swap! perc-data
			         (fn [data]
				   (-> data
			             (assoc param new-value)
				     (dissoc invalidates)
				     calc-perc)))))}])
```
4. Then we have the whole calculator component dislplaying an header and the sliders
```
(defn perc-component []
  (let [{:keys [liquid flour perc sourdough]} @perc-data
        [color diagnose] (cond
	                 (< perc 50) ["orange" "dry"]
			 (< perc 85) ["inherit" "normal"]
			 (< perc 100) ["orange" "wet"]
		         :else ["red" "soup"])]
    [:div
      [:h3 "Dough percentage calculator"]
      [:div 
       "flour: " (int flour ) "g"
       [slider :flour flour 100 2000 :perc]]
      [:div
       "liquid: " (int liquid ) "g"
       [slider :liquid liquid 30 2000 :perc]]
      [:div
       "perc: " (int perc) "% "
       [:span {:style {:color color}} diagnose]
       [slider :perc perc 10 120 :liquid ]]
      [:div
       "sourdough " (int sourdough) "%: " (* sourdough (/ flour 100)) "g"
       [slider :sourdough sourdough 10 40 :perc]]
      [:div
       "salt 2%: " (* 2 (/ flour 100)) "g"]]))
```

### MVP done, v1.0 tag
This is it for the MVP of [this project](https://github.com/DennyJohansson/baking)! I have created a git tag v1.0 and it will be in the state as it is now when I'm writing this!

#### Continue???
When I continue with this calculator I want to do:
- [ ] Create some smooth slider to easily inc/dec the numbers! Then I would't need to add a max limit!
- [ ] Save the state in localStorage
- [ ] Being able to save history to server, perhaps using [re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame)
